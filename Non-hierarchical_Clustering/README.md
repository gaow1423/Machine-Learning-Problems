1. Implement the K-means algorithm. Run your K-means algorithm with k = 2. To verify that your algorithm actually converges, please plot the objective of the K-means algorithm (i.e., the SSE) as a function of the iterations. From one run to another run, this curve may look different. Just present the results of a typical run.
2.  Now apply your K-means implementation to this data with different values of k(consider values 2, 3, · · · , 10). For each value of k, please run your algorithm 10time, each time with a different random initialization, record the lowest SSE value achieved inthese 10 repetitions for each value of k. Plot the record the SSE values against the charging k value. What do you think would be a proper k value based on this curve? Please provide justification for your choice.
